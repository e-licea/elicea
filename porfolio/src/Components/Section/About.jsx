                If you asked where I would see myself in a few years about four years ago, I would never have guessed I would be spending most of my time creating functions having fun behind a keyboard.

                My first exposure to programming was when I had discovered the concept of automation. I had came across a type of trendy bot that is known as a "sneakerbot", which is made to automate the task of buying sneakers online. No time was wasted, I began to tackle Python in hopes of building my own. In the mist of it, I was fortunate enough to expose myself to open-source, and choose Linux as my preffered Operating System. I learned to run Linux as single-boot, dual-boot, and as a virtual machine, all of which exposed me to new topics and subtopics from the world of computers. I enjoyed running into obstacles beacuse I knew that it always came with something new to learn if I had the grit.

                However, at some point I ran into an obstacle that led to a dramatic learning curve. I realized I was self-learning with no sense of direction or end-game. I was overwhealmed with knowledge on the internet and lacked strong foundational skills. So, I decided to join Lambda School, where I had a learning pathway with great instructors that focused on building strong fundamentals. I learned front-end, back-end, and computer science with Python in great depths. Finally, I was able to fill in gaps in my learning and discover new topics that I did not know I wanted to learn. Lambda School became an excellent experience for me and allowed me to gain the confidence to conduct real projects on my own.

                Currently, I am on a continued journey in the world of programming. My motivation comes from a never satisfied hunger to learn. My goal is to use my skills to benefit people around me, and contribute to building the world of tomorrow.
